# IF/ELSE conditions are used to decide to do something based on something being true or false

y = 3

# Simple if
# if x > y:

# If else if
# if x > y:   
#     print(f'{x} is greater than {y}')
# elif x == y:

# else:
#     print(f'Fuck you')

# NESTED IF
# if x > 2:
#     if x <= 10:
#         print(f'{x} is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10')
# Comparision Operators (==, !=, >, <, =>, <=) - Used to compare values
# Logical Operators (and, or, not) - Used to combine conditional statement

# AND
# if x > 2 and x <= 12:
#     print(f'AND {x} is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 12')
# OR
# if x > 2 or x <= 12:
#     print(f'OR {x} is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 12')
# NOT
# if not(x == y):
#     print(f'NOT {x} is not equal to {y}')
